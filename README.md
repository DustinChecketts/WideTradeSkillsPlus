# Wide Trade Skills Plus

A World of Warcraft: Classic (Anniversary, Seasons, Hardcore, Era) addon that provides a widened trade skill pane for all primary and secondary professions.

Wide Trade Skills Plus simply doubles the width of the trade skills panes and allows for a longer list of recipes and receipe details in the right pane. Retains all functionality of the original panes and matches seamlessly with Blizzard's default UI.

#### **Features**

*   A dual-pane trade skill window that doubles the width of the original trade skill window
*   Full height receipe list in the left-pane with receipe details relocated to the right pane
*   Receipe levels added to the receipe titles in the left pane
*   Shortcuts to other primary and secondary trade skills appended to the right side of the frame

#### **Known Issues / To-Do**

*   Create options commands and/or window to enable/disable features
